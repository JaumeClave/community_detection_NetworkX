# Data Clustering and Community Detection in Graphs Using NetworkX
<p align="justify">Networks are graphs which are made out of nodes and edges and they are present everywhere. Social networks composed of users owned by the likes of Facebook and Twitter contain sensitive relationship data, biological networks help analyse patterns in biological systems, such as food-webs and predator-prey interactions and narrative networks help identify key actors and the key communities or parties they are involved with. The study of a network is essential in order to learn about its information spread, players of influence and its robustness. Networks inherently contain communities, areas of densely connected nodes which provide information about the network, among that information, it allows for the creation of large scale maps of a network since individual communities act like meta-nodes in the network. NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. This project utilises NetwokX to investigate two different networks, studying key centrality measures and utilising the Girvanâ€“Newman and the Louvain Modularity methods to explore network communities.</p>
